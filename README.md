# horiseon-project

<p>
  Horiseon has requested that we review their website's code and look to see if we can reorangize the layout to make it easier to edit in the future. We want to make sure that   
  the HTML code is formatted to the coding standard. We want to make the code easy to read and easy to modify going forward. This means we need to review each section, note changes,  
  and make everything uniform. Below is the list of objective we want to hit while working on this project.
