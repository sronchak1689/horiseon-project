# horiseon-project

<p>
  Horiseon has requested that we review their website's code and look to see if we can reorangize the layout to make it easier to edit in the future. We want to make sure that   
  the HTML code is formatted to the coding standard. We want to make the code easy to read and easy to modify going forward. This means we need to review each section, note changes,  
  and make everything uniform. Below is the list of objective we want to hit while working on this project. 
</p>

<h2>Objective and Goals</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Review coding</li>
  <li>Note and change code</li>
  <li>Update links</li>
  <li>check for user accessibility</li>
  <li>Check links are functional</li>
  <li>Review CSS</li>
  <li>Update and Merge CSS</li>
  <li>Note changes and issues</li>
  <li>Commit changes to Github</li>
</ol>

<h2>Main Issues Idenified</h2>

<p>While we were reviewing the page we noticed that some of the nav links were not functional for the user. We updated the href and make sure that the nav links would allow for a smoother user expereince. <br  />
  
  After checking the image links we added in the alt tag to allow for user that were using a screen reader to get the full experience of the page. This will also help with SEO <br  />
  
  There were also some formatting to the HTML code that was causing some confusion. The over use of DIV tags made it hard to tell the different sections apart. To add in this we added the section tag and put in divs within them to keep the content together and easy to code. 
  
  We also added a header and footer tag to make those sections more defined for future coders. 
  
  For the CSS code we noticed alot of multiple sections doing the same acton. We felt that the multiple sections would cause for longer coding to make changes to the titles of each section. To assist with this we gave class names to those titles so we could change time with a single CSS code. 
  
  We also wanted to make each title more aggressive to make them easier to read. We increased the font size for them to make the desired look on the mock up.
